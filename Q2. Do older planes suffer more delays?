'''
Q2. Do older planes suffer more delays? 
Years used: 1995, 1999, 2003 and 2007
Plane tailnumber used: N13113, N13624 and N14115
An entire year of flight arrival/departure delays were used with a 4 year gap between each year chosen.
Data is filtered for positive ArrDelay to retain flights that are delayed.
